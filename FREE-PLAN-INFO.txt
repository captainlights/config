# TO AVOID TERMINATION DO NOT DELETE EXISTING FILES IN THE FILE MANAGER WHILE USING THE FREE PLAN

# Deleting existing files may lead to server suspension 

# Upon upgrading to a paid plan, you may delete any existing files as you wish

# Make sure you renew your server every day to keep your free plan. Alternatively you may upgrade to a paid plan which doesn't require renewing.
